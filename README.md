Upwork (Online), Machine Learning Engineer
As a freelance machine learning engineer, I collaborated with diverse
business professionals, ranging from solo practitioners to start-up
companies. My responsibilities included debugging code,
implementing machine learning projects from inception to
deployment, and delivering client-focused solutions.
Notable Project: Predictive Model for User Response Accuracy
Developed a predictive model to determine if users would answer
questions correctly or incorrectly, collaborating closely with the client
throughout the project lifecycle.
Managed various project phases, including:
Phase 1: Data loading using SQL
Phase 2: Data cleaning and transformation using Python and SQL,
with text-to-numeric conversion via TensorFlow
Phase 3: Data visualization using Python
Phase 4: Feature engineering with Python to optimize model
performance
Phase 5: Building machine learning algorithm with data balancing
using SMOTE
Phase 6: Testing and selecting the best model for implementation
Phase 7: Deploying the model using FastAPI
Phase 8: Setting up API requests to facilitate client usage of the
developed solution
