# upwork
This was a work I did with my upwork client to predict the answers collecting different languges 

The project was to take the answer and check if the user did get the correct answer, the user is allowed to use any language of choice the algorithm was supposed to convert the language into English and check the answer. However, due to limited time, we could only have 5 languages to convert.
